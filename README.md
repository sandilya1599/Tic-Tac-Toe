# Tic-Tac-Toe

I tried to implement Tic-Tac-Toe game using Mini-Max algorithm. It was not perfect and it needs some modifications.
I also implemented Tic-Tac-Toe using random package in Python.

In this game, the user plays against the computer to win.

There will be mistakes since this is my first repo. I'll be more than happy to correct myself.
